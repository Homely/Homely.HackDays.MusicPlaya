# Results
Using HTML5 Audio can be quite easy but the main drawback in this project is the availablity of public APIs (or at least API keys/IDs). 

In this example I was able to create a simple HTML-based player, a React-based local file music player and a React-based Soundcloud + local file player. I ran out of time to attempt to integrate Spotify or YouTube or another source.

## Blockers
As mentioned above the main thing stifling progress on a project like this is API availability. Unfortunately, as most of these services rely on advertising money they are less inclined to provide easy access to their libraries. 

## Further work 
The original goal was met however I'd have preferred a Spotify + Soundcloud + YouTube player.
